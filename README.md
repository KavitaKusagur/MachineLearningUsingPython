Machine Learning is a latest __buzzword__ floating around. It desrves to, as it is one of the most interesting subfield of Computer Science.<br>
__What does Machine Learning really means?__<br>
Machine Learning is an application of artificial intelligence(AI) that provides systems the ability  to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.<br>
__Machine Learning focuses on the development of computer programs__ that can access data and use it to learn for themsleves.<br>
The process of learning begins with data, such as, direct experience, or instruction, in order to look for patterns in data and make better decisions in the future based on the examples that we provide. __The primary aim is to allow the computers learn automatically__ without human intervention or assistance and adjust actions accordingly.

### [120 Years of Olympics History](./OlympicsHistory)
![image.jpg](images/olympics.png)<br><br>
- The Olympic Games are considered the world's foremost sports competition with more than 200 nations participating. 
- A historical dataset on the modern Olympic Games, including all the Games from Athens 1896 to Rio 2016.
- An effort to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) which helps in explore the evolution of these sports, since the beggining in Athens 1896, when the first games were held, till Rio 2016, the latest ones. To Visualize, how the Olympic Games have developed over the years, changing participation trends, physical winning characteristics, geographic participation trends, special cases of interest, et al.

### [Big Mart Sales Prediction](./BigMartSales)
![image.jpg](images/bigmartsales.jpg)<br><br>
- The data scientists at __Big Mart__ have collected __2013 sales data for 1559 products across 10 stores in different cities__. Also, certain attributes of each product and store have been defined. 
- The aim is to build a predictive model and find out the sales of each product at a particular store. Using this model, BigMart will try to understand the properties of products and stores which play a key role in increasing sales.
